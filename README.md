# ðŸ“ˆ Personal Project: Building an Automated Stock Trading Bot
## Objectives: 
- Build an automated stock trading system using Python
- Apply knowledge of mathematics, finance, and programming to real+world investment
- Create a highly practical project to showcase in your portfolio for applications to positions such as Data Analyst, Quant, or Algorithmic Trader.
## Key Results
- A trading bot capable of:
  + Fetching real+time stock data
  + Performing technical analysis to make decision
  + Executing buy/sell orders based on predefined strategies.
  + Sending notifications via Telegram/Email when trades are executed.
- A well+documented README and clearly commented code on GitHub.
- A presentation slide deck + project report for portfolio or showcase purposes.
## How + Project Implementation Plan
**1. Research and Planning**
- __1.1. Define Project Scope__
  + The bot will trade at Vietnamese stocks
  + Day trading, swing trading and long+term investing
- __1.2. Explore Data Sources / APIs__
  + APIs: VCI
  + Library: Vnstock
**2. Requirements and Architecture Design**
- __2.1. Main Modules__
     + Data Collector: Collect historical and real+time market data.
     + Data Preprocessing: Clean, normalize, and handle missing values.
     + Trading Strategy Engine: Generate trading signals using technical indicators.
     + Execution Engine: Connect to a broker or simulated API to place orders.
     + Notification System: Send alerts when signals or trades occur.
     + Backtesting Module: Evaluate strategy performance on historical data.
- __2.2. Workflow Steps__
     + Identify suitable data sources for stock prices.
     + Design basic trading strategies (e.g., MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands).
     + Implement a backtesting engine to simulate trades on past data.
     + Analyze performance metrics (e.g., Sharpe ratio, win rate).
     + Write logic to automate trade execution (if API access allows).
     + Set up scheduled execution (daily/hourly) using task schedulers.
## Challenges
**- 1. Technical Challenges**
   + Limited experience using financial APIs to retrieve real+time data.
   + Lack of familiarity with time+series processing and adjusted prices.
   + No prior hands+on experience with professional backtesting frameworks like Backtrader or Zipline.
**- 2. Strategy and Logic**
   + Difficulty in selecting and tuning strategies that fit the market environment.
   + Need deeper understanding of technical indicators and risk management.
**- 3. Project Development Process**
   + Not yet proficient in modular project structuring and scalable code design.
   + Limited experience in testing (unit tests) and implementing logging/debugging workflows.
